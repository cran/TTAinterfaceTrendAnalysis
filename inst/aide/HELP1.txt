This is the first panel of the Temporal Trend Analysis Interface

This panel shows 6 options/buttons:

    _The <Import CSV File> button give you the possibility to import your data file in the interface.
     
     This file must be a 'csv' file. 'csv' files can be created using Microsoft Excel
     or OpenOffice Calc. In a 'csv' file data column are separated with ';'. 
     Decimal separator must be '.' (dote) and not ',' (comma).

    _The <Select your save directory> button give you the possibility to change the path where results and figures 
     will be saved (by default it's the same path as your .csv file). Each time you import a new
     data file, the path is return to default.

    _The <Show Data> button give you the possibility to show the data you just import in a data frame

    _The <Summary> button call the descriptive statistics of the raw data, display in the result window
     (the right part of the interface) and in the front of the screen.

    _The <Fix Data> give you the possibility to fix some problem that can occur during the importation
     of your data.

     The most common problem is the absence of parameter/dates or stations in the interface.
     This can sometimes be fix by clicking on the fix button that call a modifiable data.frame with your data.
     Then you can change the name of the column, the value of each case and the category of the data
     by clicking on the column header (two choice : numeric or character). Choose
     numeric for your parameters and character for stations and date.
     Date column must be named as 'DATES' and date must be formatted as dd/mm/yyyy.
     Sampling site column must be names as 'STATIONS'
     Salinity column must be names as 'S'
     Depth column must be names as 'DEPTH'

     Each time the fix button is used, the new file will be saved as filename_fixed.csv

The text between button 1 and 2 show the active file (also show in the header of the interface)
The text between button 2 and 3 show the current path where results are saved
